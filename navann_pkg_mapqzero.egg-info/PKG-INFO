Description: # 1. Not Another Variant Annotator
        
        Another variant annotator that leverages the ExAC server to 
        annotate ones vcf. 
        
        *Caveats*
        
        This has only been tested on FreeBayes output for two triploid samples.
        
        It only works on the human genome assembley GR37 as 
        that is all ExAC support. Also their version of VEP, which performs the annotations for the impact of the variant is rather outdated.
        
        
        ## 1.1. Getting Started
        
        There isn't much required in terms of pre-requistes, besides an internet connection. The script does support the use of snpEff, however one must already have a local copy of the software installed. This can be found here https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff
        
        ## 1.2. Running the tests
        
        No unit testing has been made for this code.
        
        ## 1.3. Built With
        
        * [py3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) - python
        * [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - python package for data manipulation
        
        ## 1.4. Versioning
        
        No verision software is used at this time
        
        ## 1.5. How to use
        
        A simple tool to annotate one's vcf.
        
        Example command to run the annotator script with all annotation functions:
        
        `python VariantFileAnnotator.py --vcf sample.vcf --verbose --outpath /path/to/outfolder/sample.ann.vcf --all`
        
        Run the annotator script with only adding vaf to the format field:
        
        `python VariantFileAnnotator.py --vcf sample.vcf --verbose --outpath /path/to/outfolder/sample.ann.vcf --vaf`
